              Almost all of us have a
              <br />
              family member, a friend, or a colleague
              <br />
              who has or is fighting this awful disease.
              <br />
              And while progress has been made, we still have a
              <br />
              long way to go in curing and caring for those who are stricken
              <br />
              For the Duke Fencing Family, this disease has struck very close to home.
              <br />
              Our own Elizabeth Beguinet is carrying on her own fight right now.  Elizabeth, the wife of our head coach Alex,
              <br />
              is not just our recruiting coordinator, or travel coordinator, or seamstress for our uniforms.
              <br />
              Sheâ€™s been our confidant, our coach, our on-campus mom, and our family for 34 years.
              <br />
              And when a member of our family fights, we all fight.
